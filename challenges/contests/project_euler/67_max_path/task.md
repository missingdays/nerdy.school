3

7 4

2 4 6

8 5 9 3

That is, 3+7+4+9=23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle given in input.

#Input Format
First line contains T, the number of testcases. For each testcase:

First line contains N, the number of rows in the triangle.

For next N lines, i'th line contains i numbers.

##Output Format
Print the required answer for each testcase on a new line.

##Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
Each element of triangle lies between 0 and 100(both inclusive).
